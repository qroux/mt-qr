We would like you to implement 2 basic features

- Update status, title and description of a ticket

A ticket has the following (minimal) attribute
- A title
- A description
- A status. Available values are "To Do", "In Progress", "To Validate" and "Complete"

This test is composed of two sections the HTTP API (in "backend" directory) and the web interface (in "frontend" directory). More information in the README of each part.

## Bonus

Some bonuses could be added like
- Unit tests
- End-to-end tests
- Ticket status history
- Ticket tags
