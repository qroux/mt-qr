# My Trello - Implicity technical test

This is the frontend section of the My Trello app. We would like to have:

**A global view of the tickets**
![trello](https://blog.trello.com/hs-fs/hubfs/How%20Managers%20Use%20Trello/TreamGoalSettingCentral.png?width=2519&name=TreamGoalSettingCentral.png)

**A form to create a ticket**

**A view to see ticket detail / edit**


## Setup 

We already initialized an [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) boilerplate for you. It has been generated by the Angular CLI. Take the time to read the documentation if your not familiar with the framework


**Install dependencies**
```shell
npm install
```

**Startup**
```shell
npm run start
```

## That all for the guidance on this section !
We wish you good luck and have fun !
